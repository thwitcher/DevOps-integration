DevOps Web Application Project

Overview : 

This project is a web application with a React front-end and a Python (Flask) back-end.
The app is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes in a Minikube environment.
We use Terraform for infrastructure as code and Jenkins for CI/CD automation, with MySQL for data storage.

Features : 

Docker: Containers are used to package both front-end and back-end applications.
Kubernetes (Minikube): Manages the deployment and scaling of containers.
Terraform: Automates infrastructure setup and provisioning.
Jenkins: CI/CD pipelines for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
